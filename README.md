# Airplane-fault-prediction

This repository is a collection of codes generated for optimizing the echo state network for RUL prediction of airplane engines.

The original data was obtained from NASA data prognostic center.

We recommend running on Matlab 2018b or later. Since in its present state each code is run 10 times, for short tests, we advice researchers to cut the number to one and see how things run first. Contact us via abala.ele@buk.edu.ng
